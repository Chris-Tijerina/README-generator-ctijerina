## Description
a README generator that can quickly create a professional README for a new project. 

Acceptance Criteria:
Given a command-line application that accepts user input, when I am prompted for information about my application repository, then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

> There were no real issues when designing the markdown file itself. The readme guide that was provided gave clear tips on what should be included in a good README.

When I choose a license for my application from a list of options, then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.

> This portion did require a little bit of research to put together, but the shields.io website made it easy to figure out. The most difficult part was decided which licenses to include. I think anyone who would be using this could possibly add their licenses to it if they really needed to. that will be noted in the instructions. 

When I click on the links in the Table of Contents, then I am taken to the corresponding section of the README. 

> This was pretty simple and it was tested to ensure it worked on the readme that was generated. 

## Instructions 

> In order to use this application you will have to download the repository, or clone it, and open it up in your chosen terminal (Vs.Code, GitBash, Terminal for Mac, etc.). Then you will have to ensure that node package manager has been installed (using "npm install" in the terminal) and you'll need to install Inquirer as well, (by typing "npm install inquirer" into your terminal). You can then run the application by typing "node index". The video below shows what will occur then:
