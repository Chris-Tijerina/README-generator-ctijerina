  ## Description
    This project was created to streamline the README creation process. By using a terminal application, you can generate a professional README markdown without having to worry about formatting. It will cover the most basic necessities of a README as well as some more advanced sections.

  ## Installation
  In order to use this application, you must clone the repository to your local environment and navigate to it through your chosen terminal.

  ## Usage
  In order to use the application itself, you must have Node Package Manager installed, which can be achieved by typing "npm install -g npm" into your terminal. You will also need Inquirer, which can be installed by typing "npm install inquirer" into your terminal. Then you can run the app by typing "node index" into your terminal. The README will be generated in the dist folder of the repository folder.
